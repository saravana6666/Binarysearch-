Java Binary Search Algorithm
Overview
This repository contains a Java implementation of the binary search algorithm. Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Features
Implements binary search on a sorted array of integers.
Handles edge cases such as empty arrays and non-existent elements.
Provides a simple and clear example of binary search in Java.
